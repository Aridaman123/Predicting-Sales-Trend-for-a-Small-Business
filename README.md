# Predicting-Sales-Trend-for-a-Small-Business

Performed in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world startup funding dataset comprising over 2,300 records with information on startup names, industry sectors, investor details, investment types, funding amounts, and geographic locations. Cleaned and preprocessed messy data, including handling missing values, inconsistent formatting (e.g., dates and currency), and text standardization.

Analyzed temporal patterns to identify funding trends over time, including peak investment periods and emerging startup sectors. Investigated sector-wise and city-wise funding distributions to reveal hotspots for startup activity and capital flow. Applied grouping and aggregation techniques to understand the most common types of investments (Seed Funding, Private Equity) and identify top investors in the ecosystem.

Designed insightful visualizations such as time series plots, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to clearly present trends in startup funding and sectoral growth. These analyses facilitated actionable, data-driven insights for stakeholders to understand where investment opportunities lie and how funding dynamics evolve across geographies and industries.
